# Open Data Science course
This course give as a general overview over the possibilities to work with data. No matter the topic, all scientists need to work with lots of data, organize it and analyze it in order to be able to understand it, explain it and represent it. This course will give us the basic tools to do so. Mainly working with R programming language and R-studio software which are probably the most widely used open source tools thanks to its robustness for statistical computing and graphics.
The core values of the course are based on the importance of open data and knowledge sharing.

# To see the whole structure:
str(learning2014)
# The dataset has 183 observations of 60 variables.
# All the variables have 5 levels (with values 1-5) except age, attitude, gender and points.
# We install package and bring it to R studio:
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
# First we select the questions that we will combine for deep, stra and surf:
deep_questions <- c("D03", "D11", "D19", "D27", "D07", "D14", "D22", "D30", "D06", "D15", "D23", "D31")
stra_questions <- c("ST01", "ST09", "ST17", "ST25", "ST04", "ST12", "ST20", "ST28")
surf_questions <- c("SU02", "SU10", "SU18", "SU26", "SU05", "SU13", "SU21", "SU29", "SU08", "SU16", "SU24", "SU32")
# Second we select the columns related to the variables:
deep_columns <- select(learning2014, one_of(deep_questions))
stra_columns <- select(learning2014, one_of(stra_questions))
surf_columns <- select(learning2014, one_of(surf_questions))
# Third we create the new columns with the combined variables, scaling to the original scales (apply mean):
learning2014$deep <- rowMeans(deep_columns)
learning2014$stra <- rowMeans(stra_columns)
learning2014$surf <- rowMeans(surf_columns)
# Scale attitude to the original scale, diving by 10:
learning2014$attitude <- learning2014$Attitude/10
# Change all column names to the first letter in lowercase, to avoid confusions:
learning2014$age <- learning2014$Age
learning2014$points <- learning2014$Points
# Excluding observations where exam points is zero:
learning2014 <- subset(learning2014, (Points > 0))
# Let's see the new dimensions:
dim(learning2014)
# I will create a subset of my data only with the columns that we will work with:
# I want to keep the name so first I will change the name of the dataset that we have now
learning2014_original <- learning2014
learning2014 <- subset(learning2014_original, select = c(gender, age, attitude, deep, stra, surf, points))
colnames(learning2014)
# Now we ave the right dimensions, 166 observations and 7 variables.
dim(learning2014)
# Set IODSproject folder to the working directory:
setwd("C:/Users/Elisabet/Desktop/ELI/MASTER'S DEGREE/Open Data Science/GitHub/IODS-project/IODS-project")
# Save the analysis datset to the data folder:
